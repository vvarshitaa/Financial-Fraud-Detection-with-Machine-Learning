Project Description: This project focuses on detecting earnings manipulation in financial data using various machine learning models, including Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, 
SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps such as downsampling to balance classes. 


Grid search was used for hyperparameter tuning across models. 


After comparing models, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel demonstrated the best performance in terms of F1-score and accuracy.
The project concludes with the SVM being the optimal model for detecting earnings manipulation in this context.
